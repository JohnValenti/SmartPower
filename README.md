Outline
Smart Energy incentives offer companies financial incentives to use energy at off-peak times.
Using organisation schedule data from Verint WFM we can predict company energy usage.
By plotting this data with national energy usage + pricing data we aim to identify key times of high enery costs and areas where companies can reduce power to save money.

Finally, we aim to link this tool with the WFM scheduler, allowing companies to create worker schedules for more off-peak times allowing them to qualify for financial rewards.
