Outline
Smart Energy incentives offer companies financial incentives to use energy at off-peak times.
Using organisation schedule data from Verint WFM we can predict company energy usage.
By plotting this data with national energy usage + pricing data we aim to identify key times of high enery costs and areas where companies can reduce power to save money.
